    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak Diane was a staple on menus in fine dining restaurants back in the day. It was prepared tableside where the server ignited the cognac for an impressive sight. This recipe is a much easier yet just as delicious version of the retro classic.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup demi-glace</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steak</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) beef tenderloin steaks, fully trimmed, pounded to ½-inch thick</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shallot, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Cognac or brandy</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sliced fresh chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steaks generously on both sides with salt. Allow steaks to come to room temperature while you make the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir together demi-glace, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over very high heat, swirling carefully to evenly cover surface. When oil reaches a smoking point, transfer steaks to oil; add a few chunks of butter. Sear meat on high heat until brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side; keep them on the rare side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Stir shallots into skillet; cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; pour in Cognac. Carefully ignite with a fireplace lighter. When alcohol burns off and flames go out, return skillet to high heat and bring to a boil; cook, stirring, a few minutes to reduce slightly. Add demi-glace mixture, cream, and any accumulated juices from the steak. Cook on high heat just until sauce starts to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer steaks back to pan and reduce heat to low. Gently simmer until meat is heated through and cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Transfer to hot plates and serve with a generous spoonful or two of sauce. Sprinkle with chives.</li>

    <h2>Chef's notes</h2>
    <p>You can use top sirloin steaks instead of tenderloin steaks. You can substitute 2 cups of a rich, low-sodium or salt-free chicken broth for the 1/2 cup of demi-glace, but it will take longer to reduce.

        You don't need to flame the cognac as the alcohol will evaporate as it cooks on the stove. But be careful — it can still flare up if the heat is high enough when you're reducing the sauce.</p>
